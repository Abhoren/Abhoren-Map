After the destruction of Reonoc, Utam pushed deep into the Bacian forest wrecking havoc among the cities. A\'lnor was the last city left untouched by the green terror and stood to defend itself. The battle raged for days and finally, in 50,000 BD, Utam was defeated. Unfortunately, much of the city was obliterated and the city scattered as refugees.","description":"A’lnor was a beautiful city. Massive steelwood trees hundreds of feet tall and thick sprouted from the ground. The roots of this metropolis formed a barrier that defended this city from attack. The trees had staircases that spiraled around the trunks and large roads suspended off the ground by the branches. The richest lived at the crown of the trees, using magic to allow houses to be built on the leaves themselves. While the poorest lived within the root structures of these trees. All these trees were seedlings of a grand tree in the center: the Silversteel. Higher than the rest, the Silversteel looked out among its children and protected the land, dissuading natural disaster and army from attacking. The oldest creature in the Bacian Forest, the Silversteel would communicate with the elders of A’lnor in ancient foeden-speak, offering counsel and warning. Only the leaders of the clans and their families had abodes on the boughs of this ancient being.<br>Now, A’lnor is a cracked shell of its former glory. The trees stand unchanged by time. However, the suspensions are broken in places, the roads crumbling and untraversable. The few homes that remain on the crowns of the trees that were not destroyed by Utam have their enchantments failing, which is causing them to slowly collapse into the ground. The great homes on the Silversteel are more intact than the rest, although they still have signs of damage.","landmarks":"\u2022 The Silversteel<br>The Silversteel is a massive tree older than any being on Abhoren. It stretches hundreds of feet into the air and has a strange magical presence about it. The tree is resistant to all magic and resists any attempt to attack it.<br>\u2022 House of Woven Branches<br>This was the ruling location of the entire kingdom, located highest on the Silversteel. The hall was made from the branches and leaves of the Silversteel itself and is the most intact place in all of A’lnor. The house itself was gigantic, and in its prime was always expanding on itself. Besides ruling, the duty of the regent was to use his magic to expand the house, fortify the building, and help the Silversteel grow strong.<br>\u2022 Arrowthrush<br>Arrowthrush was home to the bowmasters of A’lnor. This hall was made from beautiful woods and plants formed together to create a perfect resemblance of the surrounding woods. A lot of this structure was adorned with beautifully crafted bows, often many that had their own magical personalities that would choose who was their master.<br>\u2022 Gildergleam Hall<br>The main clan-hall of the merchant clan. Located on the Silversteel’s trunk, this abode was the third highest, behind only the druid’s and bowmaster’s clan-homes. Crafted solely out of golden leaves from Ailona, this structure is beautiful and opulent.<br>\u2022 House of Fates<br>The religious clan of A’lnor had their house constructed of floating pathways of magic stone, crafted carefully by the best smiths and enchanters of the time. This was the only house not directly connected to the Silversteel and floated around the fourth highest position on the tree. Since the clan’s destruction, much of the pathways leading up have lost their enchantments. Now the Silversteel uses its own powers to keep the paths and houses afloat.<br>\u2022 Bladesing and Melody Hall<br>Bladesing & Melody Hall were entwined around each other at the fifth spot down the Silversteel. The dancing blades and clan of inspiration always went into battle together, thus their houses were together. This structure was split in half, half mostly stone and half mostly wood. When the light shone through the side with stone, it lit up the beautiful gem-set stones in the walls. The many-colored light shone through to the wooden half which seemed to make the wood itself come alive and dance to an unheard beat.<br>\u2022 House of Souls<br>The House of Souls was the lowest on the ladder of Silversteel, but that did not mean that they were not important. On the contrary, they were the most respected of all the clans but preferred to be the closest to the living realm down below. Their house was shrouded in darkness with beacons of light as orbs shined out from the building. The ancestors of the Day and Night clan inhabited the house as well as the living residents."}'],

Upon their rapid approach to true enlightenment, Nyfalin was the city the gods wished to be destroyed in totality. Utam struck this city first in 49997 BD, ripping the magical staircases from the air, melting the temples to enlightenment, and dissolving the populous in an instant.","description":"While the other cities in A’lnor looked like they could exist in the mortal world, Nyfalin appeared as if it was in its own plane of existence. Nyfalin was built in one of the few large clearings in the great Bacian forest. The shimmering buildings had textures of common building materials, like maple or granite or steelwood, but were all more similar to glass: clear and shining.

Stairways connected the many buildings together and acted as the highways of this faithful city. They were built out of marble and gold leaf and jade from the far north and were the only pieces of construction that looked truly solid. Calling these massive structures ‘stairways’ does them paltry justice. Each was at least a hundred tonnes and were suspended each by complicated invocations of faith and magic. Every surface of these pathways was inlaid with the history of Foedenkind and their beliefs. A craftsman would dedicate his entire life’s work to finish just one of these colossal constructions.<br><br>T>he most beautifully crafted of the ethereal buildings floated thousands of feet in the air and was the home to the gods if they ever chose to visit this mortal city.

The grand staircases that marched through the sky covered in beautiful inlaid gold and jade and historical texts now lay on the field broken into massive pieces. The ethereal constructions all have been melted and shattered laying on the ground and have slowly had their enchantments fade and become opaque. The majestic temple that soared above Nyfalin hosted the brunt of Utam’s attack. The bottom one-hundred feet of the citadel was embedded into the ground. What could easily be seen was in sorry state, chunks were completely dissolved and what little remains whole was stripped of enchantment and adornment by centuries of looters.<br><br>In current days, the city is toxic.

After a brief war, the two kingdoms decided that if this war was to continue, both kingdoms would be wiped from the face of Abhoren. While A\'lnor tended more towards cultural enlightenment with a decent military, Pelryn quickly diverged due to the gol races constantly harrying the trade routes throughout the kingdom.

Quickly these Syffren founded a great friendship with Pelryn and helped them in their independence war in 35,250 BD. Since that war, both cities have been entwined in politics. Often Pathen has protected Pelryn from the west and Pelryn has protected Pathen from the east. Pathen relies heavily on the Icewash to cool the surrounding desert and to make it liveable for the Syffren and Foeden that reside inside the city.","description":"Pathen is a beautiful Syffrenic city, carved acropolises and large towers mark the city throughout. Beautiful bridges cast over the Icewash and connect the two sister cities of Pelryn and Pathen. A great wall surrounds the outer limits of the city and on the wall is the carved combined history of the Syffren, Foeden, and other races that have created this city.","landmarks":"\u2022 The Grand Bridge <br> This is the largest bridge between Pelryn and Pathen. It arches beautifully over the icy river and is carved from some of the finest marble. On this bridge is the main marketplace of the two cities and most trade is done here."}'],

Although a majority of the settlers went with the Foeden to Pelryn, some stayed behind. The few that stayed created this city, later named Zand after the leader of Pathen.","description":"Zand is a major port city on the southern coast of Odea. There are massive docks and large marketplaces that trade in wares from every kingdom in Abhoren. The Pinepeak mountains to the north of Zand frame the city and protect the climate from the encroaching desert to the north.
